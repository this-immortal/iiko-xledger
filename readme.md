# About

This is a simple serverless application for AWS platform. The app exports Purchase Orders from ```iiko restaurant management system``` to ```XLedger accounting system```.

The app is based on AWS Lambda technology and leverages AWS S3 for persistence. [Serverless platform](https://serverless.com)  is used for deployment. This app is a good example of hat can be built in just a matter of days using the AWS stack.

# How it works

The app consists of a few [AWS Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/), each fulfilling one task. You can say it utilizes a micro-service architecture, where each service is a Lambda function.

## Workflow

The app works in a two-phase daily cycle.
The first phase is the preparation. During this stage a mapping table is built to match ordered items in iiko and those in XLedger.

The second phase is the export itself. The app would fetch the orders from ```iiko```, convert them to XLedger format and upload to ```XLedger```. Both the fetched files (json) and converted ones (xml) are stored in S3.

## Functions

- ```invoke_mapping_update``` – scheduled invocation of *update_product_mapping*
- ```invoke_export``` scheduled invocation of *fetch_orders_from_iiko*
- ```xl_auth``` scheduled authentication in xLedger
- ```update_product_mapping``` reads products and groups from iiko and stores a mapping table to S3
- ```read_product_mapping``` reads mapping table from S3
- ```fetch_orders_from_iiko``` fetches Purchase Orders from iiko and stores them to S3
- ```s3_watcher``` is triggered when a file is added to S3 and invoke converter and uploader fuctions
- ```convert_to_xml``` converts an iiko Purchase Order (json) to XLedger format (xml)
- ```xl_upload``` uploads xml to XLedger

## Configuration

The configuration is described in the export_config.json file, that must be present in the S3 bucket named ```xledger```. The json structure describes an array of *presets* each containing credentials for accessing iiko and xledger, as well as store-to-entity mapping. 

```json

    "presets": [
        {

# Installation and deployment

## Prepare AWS Stack

### WS account and user

There's a good article on [how to configure AWS](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/?gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6AjzieWR4DPcK5APaBiP_jrPj3R4jQWKH0bmpozSHyN97iSK5jkuSlRoC5zMQAvD_BwE) at Serverless website.


## Prepare your local machine

To be able to deploy the app to AWS you will need to install node.js, npm (node package manager) and serverless framework.

### Install node / npm

Follow [**this guide**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js on your machine.

### Install Serverless framework

Install serverless framework...

```bash
npm i serverless -g
```

...and provide your AWS credentials.

```bash
sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_AWS_USER_KEY --secret YOUR_AWS_USER_SECRET
```

If stuck, see this [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA)

### Clone the repo

Clone this repo to your machine and cd to the directory where you cloned it to.

### Fix command file permissions

Make the newly created files

```bash
sudo 755 *.sh
```

## Install npm modules

```bash
./ install.sh
```

## Deploy

Run the ```serverless deploy``` command in all directories, starting with Resource

To speed this up, there's a ```deploy.h``` file in the repo, run it when deploying for the first time. 

```bash
./ deploy.sh --stage=dev
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
> aws-integration % sls deploy

```

## Upload configuration files

Create export_config.json and upload it to ```S3:xledger```.
Obtain the access certificates from xLedger and upload them to ```S3:xledger/certificates```. The files must be named exactly the same as the *presets* in ```export_config.json```, and have the ```.pfx``` extension.

## Check the results in AWS

If all went well, you should now see 3 state machines and a bunch of Lambda functions in your AWS console.

## Remove the application

If you'd like to remove the application from AWS, just run the ```remove.sh```

```bash
./ remove.sh
```
